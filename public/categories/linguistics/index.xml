        <description>&lt;img src="http://localhost:1313/post/language-survival/cover.webp" alt="Featured image of post The language that survived over centuries in a single letter" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;most respected reader,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i have to apologize that you&amp;rsquo;ve had to wait for more than three months for the new article. you must have been very thirsty. you know that i love you and i know that you love me too, so all will be fine. besides, my first novel is about to hit the shelves (with the intensity of an h-bomb, in my humble estimation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;do you remember learning about the linear a script in school? it&amp;rsquo;s the mysterious predecessor of the today-deciphered linear b script, both from crete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one of the reasons we still cannot read most of linear a is because we don&amp;rsquo;t have enough material to work with, let alone some kind of rosetta stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;linear a might have been the script of a civilization that thrived more than 3000 years ago [1], and it may make you think that &amp;ldquo;lost&amp;rdquo; languages must, in some way, be very ancient and distant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if they are lost, that must be because they are very, very old, and written in some kind of alien script, or spoken by some people who wore only robes and ate chicken drumsticks straight from the fire, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;otherwise, someone would have recorded them, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;unfortunately, some languages died out before we realized we had little or no written sources of them left, even in times when print was widespread and paper almost as available as today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one of them was crimean gothic, a language whose last trace of existence dates to the late 18th century.[2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;about who spoke this language, what it was like, who wrote it down and how it died out, we will talk about today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-goths-in-the-stew-of-nations-in-crimea&#34;&gt;the goths in the stew of nations in crimea
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;alexander vasilev, &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; russian byzantinologist (well, i don&amp;rsquo;t know any others) gives us some sources on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;vasilev writes that the goths had reached the shores of the black sea by the middle of the 3rd century ad. [4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;these goths then coexisted with various other ethnic groups, while the ottoman empire later conquered crimea, leading to the crimean khanate, before crimea ended up being a part of the russian empire in the 18th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;however, the first potential reference to crimean goths having their own language comes from st cyril. the guy that un-barbarized, umm sorry, brought christianity to the slavic tribes in the ninth century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cyril says [2]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we know many peoples who understand books, and who praise god, each in its own language. such, clearly, are &amp;hellip; the goths &amp;hellip;
now, he implies reading. reading implies the existence of a written language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the first thing that comes to mind is the gothic bible, or the wulfila bible, written in a language called bible gothic. but were the crimean goths really reading a bible in the language they spoke? in other words, were they speaking a language different from the one in the gothic bible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the crimean goths spoke different languages, such as greek, tartar* and hungarian, according to georgius torquatus, a 16th century german theologician. perhaps some were reading the bible in greek?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the crimean goths were just one of many peoples on crimea at that time, and the documentation on them is sparse. as if most visitors to crimea didn&amp;rsquo;t differentiate them from other groups, perhaps due to their ability to blend in when talking to foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a certain giosafat barbaro, a venetian traveller who happened to have a german-speaking servant when he visited crimea around 1450 notes that his servant was able to communicate with the goths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but he, unfortunately, doesn&amp;rsquo;t record a single word of the language. [2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;more interestingly, pachymeres, a byzantine scholar and i.a. historian from the 13th century, notes that different people in crimea started adopting tartar cultural traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s likely that tartar was the second language of many crimean goths, notes macdonald stearns in his comprehensive analysis of crimean gothic and related sources from 1978.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;macdonald stearns wrote the most comprehensive work on crimean gothic i could find, gathering tons of first-hand sources and papers on the topic. you can find his book in the sources list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the goths in crimea kind of just existed until one belgian diplomat, oghier ghiselin de busbecq, documented their language and left us, the curious people of the 21st century, with more questions than answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ogier ghiselin de busbecq in the ottoman empire
ogier ghiselin de busbecq, the son of george ghiselin ii, a nobleman, and a certain woman to whom the latter was not married, has enjoyed high-quality education and soon after, he caught the eye of charles v, the holy roman emperor, and was &amp;ldquo;legitimized&amp;rdquo; in regard to the issue of his birth. [6]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;de busbecq was interested in various subjects, from biology to greek manuscripts to diplomacy.[3] most importantly, he was a good observer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;he was appointed as an ambassador for the holy roman empire to the ottoman empire in 1555. [6] except it&amp;rsquo;s not accurate to imagine that as, for example, a modern ambassador of hungary to thailand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the ottoman empire, at this point, was seen as a legitimate threat to the rest of europe as it encroached on hungarian territory, and busbecq was on a peace mission. busbecq entering the hostile territory of the ottoman empire was something like nixon stepping out of a plane onto chinese ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;during this time in turkey, busbecq wrote letters. he wrote about how he and his colleagues were treated, about the ottoman army, about the turks&amp;rsquo; opinions on alcohol, architecture, marriage&amp;hellip; [7]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what is most important for us is the fourth letter, the letter which contains the only surviving text in crimean gothic. the only source about this language that likely existed at least up until the end of the 18th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so, what is that surviving text?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the turkish letter of 1562: the 101 words of broken crimean gothic
the letter, written in latin, was a result of busbecq meeting a crimean envoy in constantinople (istanbul), one of whom was a greek who spoke crimean gothic. [2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this caught the attention of busbecq. he asked the man about the tartars and then wrote down some of the words that the man repeated to him, noting that there were &amp;ldquo;just as many words completely different&amp;hellip; from our own&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the first list consists of words he deemed similar to the ones of his native language (flemish), while the second list were words he deemed different. he also compiled a list of numbers and three lines of a song.[7]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;stearns&amp;rsquo; reconstruction of crimean gothic
even if we cut down all the centuries-old weeds of political questions that cover crimea and its demographics, concluding much about this language from only 101 unique forms, noted by a non-native speaker as heard from a non-native speaker, is a hard task. it&amp;rsquo;s kind of like looking at a three-year-old&amp;rsquo;s drawing of a bird and trying to figure out which species it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;crimean gothic also has no known ancestor or descendant, making comparative analysis even harder. most of the text busbecq wrote down consists of isolated words with very little grammatical or morphological info. he also didn&amp;rsquo;t bother to write down the articles which he mentions existed in the language. [2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;despite the limitations, stearns takes a look at the etymology and phonetics using what we know about mariupol greek, spoken by a mix of peoples who emigrated onto russian territory in the 18th century. mariupol greek being the closest thing to crimean greek, probably the native language of the guy who recited all those words to busbecq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;stearns concludes that busbecq was pretty accurate in judging which forms were or were not of germanic origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;busbecq was not a linguist, much less a modern linguist. he seemed to tend to write the words in the way they would be written in his language, and occasionally how they would be written in german.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but what other way did he have? what would your instincts be, as a 16th century diplomat, encountering a strange language that sounds like yours?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;finally, stearns presents how crimean gothic may have evolved from proto-germanic and how busbecq distorted what he heard in this high-ranking telephone game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as already mentioned, much, much less data is available for drawing any conclusions about the morphology of crimean gothic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;remember the three lines of a song that busbecq also included in the letter? we don&amp;rsquo;t exactly know what they mean, despite the most various interpretations. busbecq provides no translation, probably because he, too, didn&amp;rsquo;t understand the song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you do want to keep reading on the limited conclusions stearns and/or other authors have managed to come to, feel free to. unfortunately, going over all of them would turn my blog into a blog about crimean gothic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the unsettling question is: how come the language of a centuries-old community disappears with almost no trace? and why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;how languages fade away
being bilingual while living in an area controlled by and/or mostly populated by a group not speaking your language is a thing that happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as the existing sources tell us, this was the case with the crimean goths. eventually, a similar thing happened to modern crimean tartars under about two and a half centuries under russian control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;languages most often don&amp;rsquo;t die because of radical, sudden catastrophes like war or natural disaster (although they can). more often, it&amp;rsquo;s economic, cultural or political shifts, not rarely stretching over centuries, that lead to a language &amp;ldquo;dissolving&amp;rdquo;, not uncommonly through its speakers becoming bilingual. [9]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in these modern times, thanks, le globalization, and thanks le great european explorers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s easy to make the point that we can&amp;rsquo;t always know how great the scope of what we don&amp;rsquo;t know is. including the languages like crimean gothic for which we have no written sources. or lanaguages that, perhaps, at some point, will surface from nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a point that is worth making is: at the time when crimean gothic existed, these two things were likely happening:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;those who came in contact with crimean gothic considered it unnecessary to, or didn&amp;rsquo;t have the skill to document it, and
those who visited crimea never noticed the language due to its speakers being bilingual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my first point comes from the fact that, in the times where much archeological work consisted of robbery and ethnological work on highly subjective impressions, language documentation was not taken as seriously as today. it was also slightly less easy, considering the lack of digital technology.[8]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it was only in the 1990s that the broader scientific community started taking language endangerment seriously. crimean gothic, and many other languages, were gone for good at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we have learned by now, haven&amp;rsquo;t we? when the last of one thing dies, like the last native speaker of a language, a little bit of diversity it carried also dies with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;crimean gothic, if it was to be documented at its time, could have only relied on paper and pen. but does documenting a language on digital device, or online, truly conserve it forever?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;languages dying out is nothing new, but our diagnosis since the 2000s should bring us to the emergency room. [10]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;today, we&amp;rsquo;re doing the best that a massive, barely controllable train of humanity can do to brake before it reaches a dead end and tumbles. right? we must be infinitely better than those who came before us, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;right. no, really, we must be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;perhaps we can hold off, just a slight bit longer, the foolish dream of a seemingly harmonious world where everyone would speak one language and where diversity would turn into an indistinguishable puree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;most respected reader, thank you for sticking to this article while a hundred other things were happening around you. do you have any questions? ideas? complaints about the site? let me know through one of my channels in the footer, at the bottom of this page.&lt;/p&gt;
